lentil
======

Project overview
--------
lentil is a Ruby on Rails Engine that supports the harvesting of images from Instagram and provides several browsing views, mechanisms for sharing, tools for users to select their favorite images, an administrative interface for moderating images, and a system for harvesting images and submitting donor agreements in preparation of ingest into external repositories. Built according to the principles of “responsive design,” lentil is designed for use on mobile devices, tablets, desktops.

History
-------
lentil is extracted from the [My #HuntLibrary project](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/dli/projects/MHL) at [NCSU Libraries](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/). My #HuntLibrary was created as a platform to foster student and community engagement with the new building via social media imagery and to preserve and archive these images as part of the record of the Hunt Library launch. Images from this crowdsourced documentation effort will be selected to become part of our permanent digital collections, allowing the NCSU community to contribute to the historical record of the Hunt Library through image submissions as well as the use of voting tools.

Disclaimer
----------
Source code will be available in this repository soon. We are not currently using the extracted version of the code in production, so lentil should initially be considered an alpha release.
