# Infinite-Scroll #
**Contributors:** beaver6813, dirkhaim, paul.irish, benbalter  
**Donate link:** http://www.infinite-scroll.com  
**Tags:** ajax, pagination, scrolling, scroll, endless, reading  
**Requires at least:** 3.2  
**Tested up to:** 3.4  
**Stable tag:** 2.0b  

Automatically append the next page of posts (via AJAX) to your page when a user scrolls to the bottom. 

## Description ##

Infinite scroll has been called autopagerize, unpaginate, endless pages. But essentially it is pre-fetching content from a subsequent page and adding it directly to the user’s current page.

When a user scrolls towards the bottom of the page, the next page of posts is automatically retrieved and appended. This means they never need to click "Next Page", which *dramatically increases stickiness*.  

Features:

* Works out-of-the-box for many popular WordPress themes -- just activate the plugin and scroll
* Fully customizable to adapt to your site and theme
* Requires no (hopefully) template hacking, only a knowledge of CSS selectors.
* Relies on shared database of common themes to simplify installation process
* Maintain local database of theme presets for all installed themes (shared across network on multisite installs)
* Countless API endpoints to modify the behavior.
* Backwards compatible: Will not break RSS readers, mobile devices, or browsers with javascript

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What exactly is infinite scrolling? ###

Essentially it is pre-fetching content from a subsequent page and adding it directly to the user’s current page. [More Information](http://www.infinite-scroll.com/the-interaction-design-pattern/)

### Can I change the number of posts loaded? ###

Yes. Go to Settings -> Reading in your WordPress administrative dashboard.

### How do I change the alignment of the loading image? ###

Add the following to your theme's css: `#infscr-loading img { text-align: ALIGNMENT; }` where "ALIGNMENT" is either `left`, `right`, or `center`.    

### How can I pass additional arguments such as behavior or callbacks to the script? ###

Add a filter to `infinite_scroll_options` and adds additional options to the options array.

### Is the plugin available in my language? ###

If you enjoy the plugin and are interested in contributing a translation (it's super easy), please take a look at the [Translating WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) page. 

### Is it SEO-Friendly? ###
Yes all enhancements are made via javascript only, so search spiders see no difference.

### Is it accessible? ###

Things won’t change for screen-readers. This technique degrades gracefully.

### Does it still keep going, even at the end of the blog? ###

Infinite scroll is configured to die when it hits a 404 Not Found status code, so when it goes through all your archives it should hit a /page/43/ (or something) that doesn’t exist, then show a message "Congrats, you’ve reached the end of the internet." Some WordPress themes don’t report not found pages with a 404. Try a different theme or contacting the theme author.

### Do I need to edit my theme to make this work? ###

Probably not, nope.

### How do I pass additional arguments such as callbacks to the Infinite Scroll script? ###

To pass additional arguments to the Infinite Scroll script, add the following code to either your theme's `functions.php` or to a stand-alone plugin file. 

```
function my_infinite_scroll_options_filter( $options ) {
     $options['callback'] = 'my_callback';
     $options['another_parameter'] = 'another_value';
     return $options;
}

add_filter( 'infinite_scroll_js_options', 'my_infinite_scroll_options_filter' );
```
